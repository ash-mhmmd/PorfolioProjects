-- [1] 5 OLDEST USERS: We want to reward users who have been around the longest

SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 5;


-- [2] MOST POPULAR REGISTRATION DAY: We need to figure out when to schedule an ad campaign

SELECT 
    DAYNAME(created_at) AS day,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM users
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 2;


-- [3] INACTIVE USERS (NO PHOTOS): We want to target inactive users with an email campaign

SELECT username
FROM users
LEFT JOIN photos
    ON users.id = photos.user_id
WHERE photos.id IS NULL;


-- [4] MOST POPULAR PHOTO (& ITS USER): We want to find the winner of our contest to get the most likes on a single photo

SELECT
    username,
    photos.id,
    photo.image_url,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM photos
INNER JOIN likes
    ON likes.photo_id = photos.id
INNER JOIN users
    ON photos.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY photos.id
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;


-- [5] PHOTOS PER USER: Investors want to know what our engagement is like and see how many times does the average user post
    -- total numbers of photos / total number of users
    
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users);


-- [6] TOP 5 HASHTAGS: A brand/advertiser wants to know what are the most popular hashtags to use in a post

SELECT
    tags.tag_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM photo_tags
JOIN tags
    ON photo_tags.tag_id = tags.id
GROUP BY tags.id
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 5;


-- [7] FINDING BOTS: We have a problem with bots and need to identify them

SELECT
    username,
    COUNT(*) as num_likes
FROM users
INNER JOIN likes
    ON users.id = likes.user_id
GROUP BY likes.user_id
HAVING num_likes = (SELECT(COUNT(*) FROM photos);
